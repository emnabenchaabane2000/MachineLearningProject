# MachineLearningProject

In this project we will analyse the Goodreads-books dataset and train a model that predicts a bookâ€™s rating.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

The preliminary step consists in installing the Python interpreter on your computer.

Installing Python is a one-time operation. If you already installed Python in the past (for example, to run a different program), you do not need to install it again, and you can skip to the next section.
Say what the step will be
## Step 1: Download The Installer

Scroll to the bottom of the page and use the Python installer for your system to install it.




You will get a page listing all the new features of Python 3.6.0:

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
